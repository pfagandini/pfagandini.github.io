My research has led to publications in peer-reviewed journals. During my postdoc, I enhanced my data analysis and machine learning skills by working with large datasets. In industry roles at @Pro-Chile, @ID Consulting, and @TimeWe.Tech, I’ve applied these skills to develop software for optimizing bids, create economic reports on macroeconomic trends, and forecast time series using Machine Learning.
