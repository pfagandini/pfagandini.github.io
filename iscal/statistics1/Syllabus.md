Bachelor's Degree in Management  
Course Director: Professor Dr. Maria Teresa Fortunato Pereira Esteves  
Academic Year: 2025/2026

Course Unit: Statistics I \- English Track  
Field: Data Science and Statistics  
Course Coordinator: Sandra Custódio

Instructor: Paulo Fagandini  
Year/Semester: 2nd Year / 3rd Semester  
Weekly Hours: 3 Hours  
ECTS: 4

### General Objective

At the end of the course, students should understand index number theory, acquire basic concepts of random variables, and be able to identify and apply key probability models in the context of random phenomena. The main goal is to convey these concepts in a way that enables reasoning in uncertain environments and supports learning other statistical techniques.

### Competencies

Students should:

* Understand methodologies related to index numbers, probabilities, random variables, and parameters.  
* Acquire skills for the combined use of different statistical techniques to obtain results that support decision-making in random environments.  
* Be able to use the main statistical techniques to perform analyses and interpret results in business and institutional contexts.

### Learning Outcomes

The student should:

* Master the methodology of index numbers within the context of key economic and financial indicators.  
* Master the fundamental concepts of probability theory and calculate probabilities associated with random phenomena.  
* Be able to characterize random variables and identify their probability distributions.  
* Gain competence in combining various statistical techniques to support decision-making in uncertain environments.

### Assessment Methods

Assessment may be continuous or through a final exam.

#### Continuous Assessment

| Assessment Element | Weight (%) | Duration  | Syllabus  | Date |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Midterm | 60% | 80 minutes | Topics 1 and 2 | Week Nov 11-15 |
| Partial Exam | 40% | 80 minutes | Topic 3 | Regular Exam Date |

Notes:

* Continuous assessment includes two in-person written tests (Midterm and Exam).  
* Students must score at least 7/20 on each test and attend all evaluation sessions (not 6.9 or 6.99).  
* Students qualifying for the continuous assessment may choose to take the Partial Exam during the regular exam period. Alternatively, they can choose to take the Full Exam.  
* If the partial exam is chosen, the final grade will be a weighted average: Final Grade \= 0.6 Midterm \+ 0.4 Partial Exam  
* There is no minimum attendance requirement.


#### Final Exam Assessment

Students may opt for a final exam worth 100% of the grade, covering the entire syllabus.
