5. Wayne Industries reported sales using the chain index shown in the following table:

::: {.table}
| Year | `r y-6`| `r y-5` | `r y-4` | `r y-3` | `r y-2` | `r y-1` | `r y` |
| ---  | :---:   | :---:   | :---:   | :---: | :---:   | :---:   | :---: |
| Sales Index | 120 | 125 | 135 | 145 | 150 | 160 | 165 |
:::

a) The average growth rate between `r y-6` and `r y` was approximately: 

Note this is a chain link index, so each index is the relative size of year $y$ with respect to year $y-1$, or in otherwords each value of this index, is the growth each year:

$$
\left(1.2\times 1.25\right)
$$

`r round(165/120-1,4)*100`

<!-- `r mcq(c("50%", "42.86%", answer="46.01%", "None of the above"))` 


b) The growth rate for sales between `r y-7` and `r y` is approximately: `r mcq(c(answer="1062.8%","65%","42.86","None of the above"))`

c) `r torf(TRUE)` The average semi-annual growth rate between `r y-4` and `r y-1` is approximately 23.10%.

d) `r torf(FALSE)` The value for the semi-annual growth rate, in real terms, if the IPC (fix base) went from 130 in `r y-4` to 180 in `r y-1`, is approximately equal to 10%.
