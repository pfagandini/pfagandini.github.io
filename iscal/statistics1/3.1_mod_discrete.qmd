## Types of random variables

- We studied a couple of ways in which we could categorize the random variables.

- One of these classifications was *discrete* and *continuous* random variables.

- We will start by focusing in the first family of *r.v.s*

## Types of random variables

- According to the type of event we are measuring, we can do even better, and cluster together random variables that behave similarly.

- We will define *families* of **statistical distributions**. Knowing to which statistical distribution our random variable belongs, will endow us with a set of tools to deal with them adequately.

# Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions

# Hypergeometric Distribution

# Geometric Distribution

# Poisson Distribution
