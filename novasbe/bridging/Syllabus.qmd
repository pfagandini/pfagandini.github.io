PhD in Economics and Finance
Academic Year: 2025/2026

Course Unit: Bridging Mathematics
Instructor: Paulo Fagandini
:mail: : paulo.fagandini@novasbe.pt

Year: 1st Year
Weekly Hours: 22.5 Hours  
ECTS: 0

### General Objective

The course should provide a coverage of the basic mathematical concepts students should be familiar with before entering the coursework of the doctorate. Furthermore, they will be exposed to some proof techniques and mathematical methods. If time permits, we will also cover some pieces of software that could prove useful for the students throughout the semester.

### Course unit contents

Functions, Topology and Continuity, Differentiation, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Static and Dynamic Optimization, Probability Theory, and Markov Chains.

### Learning Outcomes

Students should become familiarized with basic mathematical concepts that are crucial for the understanding of the subsequent doctoral courses. Moreover, they should be familiarized with proof techniques and the use of some classical theorems.

The content and exercises are based mainly on those two references (*). However, if you want to go deeper, with the topics of the first 4 days, I suggest Simon and Blume’s book. If you want to see the advanced level of mathematical economics (specially the theoretical ground of optimization) I suggest Rakesh V. Vohra’s book, their exposition and simplicity for complex issues is beautiful.
