### About Me

I am a Business Engineer, and I serve as Assistant Professor of Economics (Adjunct) at the Lisbon Accounting & Business School. I am also Assistant Professor (Adjunct) at Nova School of Business and Economics and I am a member of the CEFAGE Research Center. I also teach Economics at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Technology at Universidade Europeia.

My research focuses mostly on applied economics. Previously I worked on corporate finance and applied microeconomic theory, mainly on auctions, contract theory, and matching. I have published my research in peer reviewed journals like Computational Economics and Managerial and Decision Economics.

I also have experience as economist and consultant and I am the author of an online LaTeX course.
